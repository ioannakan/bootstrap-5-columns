## bootstrap-5-columns

Bootstrap five columns layout. This is inspired by this [SO answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21142019/940030).

It levarages Bootstrap's own LESS mixin functions is the cleanest and more future-proof solution. Furthermore it gives you all the `offset`, `pull`, `push` classes as well. A quick look at the source code reveals that I can achieve that easily with what you can see in `./less/bootstrap-5-columns.less`.
